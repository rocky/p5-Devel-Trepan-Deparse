This file is shared by both Deparse.pod and Deparse.pm after
its __END__
Deparse.pod is useful in the Github wiki:
https://github.com/rocky/Perl-Devel-Trepan-Deparse/wiki
where we can immediately see the results and others can contribute.

The version Deparse.pm however is what is seen at
https://metacpan.org/module/Devel::Trepan::Deparse and when folks
download this file.

=head1 NAME

Devel::Trepan::Deparse - Perl Deparse plugin for L<Devel::Trepan> via L<B::DeparseTree>

=head1 SUMMARY

This adds I<deparse> and I<deval> commands to the L<Devel::Trepan>
debugger; I<deparse> deparses Perl code; I<deval> evaluates de-parsed
Perl at the current point in the Perl program that you are stopped at.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Perl reports location only at the granularity of a line number. Sometimes you would like better or more precise information. For example suppose I am stopped on this line taken from I<File::Basename::fileparse>:

     if (grep { $type eq $_ } qw(MSDOS DOS MSWin32 Epoc)) {  # ...

In a debugger, there happen to be to distinct locations in the code that you might be stopped in.
The first place is before the grep starts at all. Here, deparse will show:

      grep { $type eq $_; } 'MSDOS', 'DOS', 'MSWin32', 'Epoc'

But also you might be stopped inside grep. Here deparse will show:

    $ deparse
    grepwhile, pushmark B::OP=SCALAR(0x563a8ab1c268)
        at address 0x563a871c07d0:
    if (grep { $type eq $_ } 'MSDOS', 'DOS', 'MSWin32', 'Epoc') {
             |    # code to be run next...

The C<|> indicates that a "pushmark" really doesn't have an exact
correspondence in the source text, but roughly here it is about where
you would just before stepping into the block. In partular variable C<$_> has not
been set.

But notice that when we C<step> athough we are on the same line, we
are at a different position in the statement:

    $ step
    $ deparse

    (trepanpl): deparse
    not my, padsv B::OP=SCALAR(0x563a8abd51a8)
        at address 0x563a871c0a78:
    $type eq $_
    -----

So now we are actually inside the block, and so C<$_> is now set. If
the above wasn't enough context to indicate where you are the C<-p>
option on deparse will show you parent levels in the tree:


(trepanpl): deparse -p 3

    00 not my:
    $type
     - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
    01 binary operator eq:
    $type eq $_
     - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
    02 statements:
     $type eq $_
     - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
    03 map grep block:
    grep { $type eq $_ } 'MSDOS', 'DOS', 'MSWin32', 'Epoc'
    (trepanpl): 00 not my:
    $type
     - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
    01 binary operator eq:
    $type eq $_
     - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
    02 statements:
    $type eq $_
     - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
    03 map grep block:
    grep { $type eq $_ } 'MSDOS', 'DOS', 'MSWin32', 'Epoc'
    (trepanpl):

=head2 deparse

Deparses Perl from interpreter OPs. See L<C<deparse>|Devel::Trepan::CmdProcessor::Command::Deparse> for more information and command syntax.

=head2 deval

This is somewhat like
L<C<eval>|Devel::Trepan::CmdProcessor::Command::Eval> or C<eval?> which
evaluates the Perl code that is about to be run, but (when it works),
it can be more reliable. Eval works on simple-minded string
manipulation via regular expressions to pull out what to evaluate, whereas C<deval> gets its
information directly from the interpreter code.

See L<C<deval>|Devel::Trepan::CmdProcessor::Command::Deval> for more information and command syntax.
